Initialise a repository so that git can be used with it. It has useful defaults - no initial commit without an explicit command.


Staging area allows changes to be made and worked on before making a commit and adding those changes to the repository. It allows us to partition changes made in the working directory into different logical 'chunks'.

Many changed files in the working directory. Add those that make a logical chunk to staging and then commit that.
