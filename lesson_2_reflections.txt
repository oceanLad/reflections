Initialise a repository so that git can be used with it. It has useful defaults - no initial commit without an explicit command.


Staging area allows changes to be made and worked on before making a commit and adding those changes to the repository. It allows us to partition changes made in the working directory into different logical 'chunks'.

Many changed files in the working directory. Add those that make a logical chunk to staging and then commit that.

Branches are useful for major changes (overall) but where we still want a earlier working version of the project.
Imagine working on a feature and we find an (unrelated) bug. Create a new branch to fix the bug, which leaves the feature work as it was, and then we can merge the bugfix in later.
